# Project Description
<!-- * My final project for EEET2481 - Embedded System Design and Implementation
* Whac-A-Mole style game with a mix of my favorite meme - BONK!
* Implemented for Nuvoton Nu-LB-NUC140 development board -->
This project includes 2 versions of bare metal operating systems for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. Version 1 is more about interracting with the Rasp using UART and Mailbox, while Version deals more with the graphical interface.

<a name="version1"></a>
# Version 1
This version mainly uses the CLI to interract with the OS using the provided commands. Compile and run the image, type `help` to see all the available commands

<a name="version2"></a>
# Version 2
This version concerns more about the Graphical User Interface, allowing the user to control what being displayed on screen, and even play a mini game called "Rescue the Pink-cess". Use the CLI to control the screen

# How to run project?
- Navigate to `src` folder
- Open the `Bonk.uvprojx` project in Keil uVision 5. It should look something like this:

- Build the project and upload it to your board

# Acknowledgement
Tool for converting between images and byte arrays: https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/. Configure as below to display properly on LCD:
- Background color: Black
- Invert image colors: Yes
- Adjust brightness / alpha threshold to expectation
- Scaling: scale or stretch to fill canvas
- Center everything
- Code output format: plain bytes
- Draw mode: Vertical - 1 bit per pixel (since this LCD uses vertical scan)
- Generate code and benefit!

Also I'd like to send my thanks to my teammates Thu·∫≠n, Trung, Tri·ªÅu for helping with this project. Fun story, this project was done during the heat of Corona pandemic in Ho Chi Minh city, where I didn't get to touch the board until the very last days. I paired up with 2 other guys who had the board, where I wrote the program and send it over to them to check pixel by pixel. Jeez it was a pain üòÇ. After nights of pair-programming in irritation, they finally managed to get the board deliver to me to fully work on the game. Finaly the product got shipped just an hour before the deadline =))
